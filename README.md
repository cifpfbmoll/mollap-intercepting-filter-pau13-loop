# Mollap Intercepting Filter

> In this repository you'll find **Mollap Intercepting Filter**. This kata is to introduce yourself into the intercepting filter pattern design. Everyone should know design programming patterns because once in all programmers life you'll have to work with different design patterns. We have chosen the intercepting filter pattern for this case because most of the applications we use every day are based around this design pattern. If you're interested into know about what's based, keep reading please.

## Motivation

We never have worked with design patterns in our short programming life, and it's wild known that the patterns help you to develop a good structure of your program and avoid future problems based on architectural aspects that you should think about before try to develop any kind of software. Now that we start to feel confident about the code that we develop, we thought that could be a really great full idea to us learn different design patterns and understand why they're so important on software development. One of the biggest motivations we could have found to design this pattern it's already known and it's because most of the applications we use every day are based in the intercepting filter pattern. For example Uber use it.

## Reflections

For this kata we have decided to develop the Intercepting Filter Design pattern. This patter usually it's used when we want to do some pre-processing/post-processing with the request or response of the application. The filters are defined and applied on the request before passing the request to actual target applications. Thanks to this pattern I got to understand how the app process all the needed logic before dispatch any order or send any confirmation and I founded really useful to prepare myself into similar situations developing software related with the intercepting filter pattern. Give a look to the code if you're interested, the example showed in this repository is really simple but it gets the goal of understanding why is needed.
